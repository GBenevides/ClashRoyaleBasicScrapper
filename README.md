# Clash Royale Basic Card Scrapper
Basic scrapper for player card stats using the official ClashRoyale developer api.

1. Create an account (if you don't already have one) and generate an API key corresponding to your *public IP* (IPv4) -> https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/
2. Fill out the `configcardRetrieverConfig.txt` file with your player tag *without* the # sign ! 
3. Run the python script 
4. If all went well, a "result.csv" file should be available in current working directory ;)
